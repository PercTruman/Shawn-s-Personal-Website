                <p>My name is Shawn and I'm new to the software engineering field. For the past twenty years, I have been the assistant director of bands/percussion co-ordinator at Mansfield Summit High School in Arlington.</p>
                <p> It is definitely a bit scary to change careers, especially after being in education for so long.  However, I really am enjoying the creativity and overall thrill of problem solving that coding requires. Though I am focusing on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I can surely see my menu of acquired languages increase.  I will be completing the software engineering curriculum at the Flatiron School in July.  Thereafter, I will eagerly pursue a career in this exciting field.</p>

                    <p>This is Shilloy, my wife of nearly sixteen years.  She is a palliative care nurse practicioner at the Methodist Health Care System, and she adores what she does.  Prior to that she had been a family care nurse practicioner with QuestCare in Arlington and Mansfield.</p>
                    <p>In her spare time, she enjoys singing in the Arlington Master Chorale, and is involved in the "MAD project," another chamber singing organization which specializes in smaller settings.</p>

                    <p>Autumn is going to be 5 years old at the end of June.  She and her sister attend Mansfield Montessori, and she is currently working on her newly-acquired reading and writing skills.  She is our out-going, athletically adept child, who enjoys climbing anything, trampoline parks, and anything Disney.</p>
                    <p>Her sister Allisyn, who only recently turned 17 months, has some remarkable differences to her sister.  She is more attached to being held that Autumn had been.  She eats an inordinate amount of food, whereas Autumn is much pickier (and more likely to fill up on snacks).  Allisyn is showing a predilection for music and dancing, which may evolve into something later (an exciting prospect for her musical parents.)</p>

                    <p>I started playing this game about 10 years ago with my friend Louis. He is as obsessed with the game as I am. It is a futuristic, tabletop wargame played with miniatures that you collect, build, and paint.  Typically it is played on a 6-by-4-foot table, and can take between 2 and 4 hours to play.</p>
                    <p>I play with my friend Louis; we have been obsessing about this hobby together for about the last 10 years. Below is a collection of some of the models I've painted.</p>
